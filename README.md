# Project Description: Predictive Modeling for Walmart Sales

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of retail, accurate sales forecasting stands as a cornerstone for efficient operations. Walmart, a global retail leader, recognizes the significance of precise sales predictions for inventory management, resource allocation, marketing strategies, and customer satisfaction. This project employs regression analysis to create a predictive model for Walmart's sales. The outcomes aim not only to contribute to academic growth but also to address practical challenges within real-world retail analytics. The predictive model and insights generated possess the potential to significantly impact operational decisions at Walmart, illustrating the transformative power of data-driven approaches in the retail sector.

## Objectives
- **Data Study & Preprocessing:** Analyze provided data, preprocess, and extract relevant features.
- **Regression Modeling:** Select an appropriate regression model to predict sales.
- **Model Training & Optimization:** Train and fine-tune the chosen model using the dataset.
- **Performance Assessment:** Evaluate the model's performance using pertinent metrics such as RMSE, R-squared, and Cross-Validation.

## Research Questions
1. **Variation in Weekly Revenue:** How does sales revenue vary between holiday weekends and non-holiday weekends?
2. **Correlation with Temperature:** Is there a correlation between temperature and weekly revenue? If so, what influences this relationship?
3. **Impact of Economic Indicators:** How do economic indicators like CPI and fuel prices affect weekly sales?
4. **Predictive Modeling for Store Sales:** Can sales for a store be predicted based on various parameters when the store's location is unknown?

## Data Sources
- **Walmart Store Sales Data:** Historical sales data from various Walmart stores covering crucial variables like store number, date, weekly sales, holiday flags, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment.
- **Holiday Events Information:** Specific holiday dates like Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas impacting sales, linked to the "Holiday_Flag" variable.

## Data Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis:** Examination of numerical features such as Weekly Sales, Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, and Unemployment.
- **Bivariate Analysis:** Insights into categorical features and their relationship with sales, including store performance and holiday effects.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Patterns in sales across different years and months, identifying peak sales periods.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Understanding relationships between variables affecting sales.

## Model Development & Analysis
- **OLS Regression:** Initial analysis exploring the relationship between weekly sales and unemployment rates.
- **Multiple Variables OLS Regression:** Advanced model including multiple predictors like temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment, months, and holiday flags.
- **Polynomial Regression:** Assessing the model's fit before and after tuning to enhance predictive accuracy.
- **KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regressors:** Evaluating different regression models and their accuracy before and after tuning, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
- **Business Implications:** Insights derived from the analysis are crucial for resource allocation, inventory management, and strategic planning, with models providing strong predictive power.
- **Limitations:** Lack of precise location information impacts the models' ability to capture regional nuances influencing sales.
- **Future Directions:** Suggested improvements include incorporating new data sources, addressing overfitting, and exploring market-specific models for adaptive forecasting.

This project endeavors to demonstrate the power of predictive modeling in enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making in the retail sector, specifically within Walmart's context.
